# Analysis Code
The folder includes supplementary code which aids in creating a directed graph grid of the area of interest, determine the sensor detection rate across a sensor grid, and visualize the estimated paths of interest throughout the routing pipeline.

## overpass queries
Here are sample code to extract node (intersection) information in a grid of interest. Input the code into overpass turbo to visualize and extract the information: http://overpass-turbo.eu/

## sensor detection analysis
Understanding the sensor detection rates of the sensors across your area of interest will provide a means of better data interpretability. More information available within each script's header.

## visualize estimated paths
Throughout the routing pipeline, you can visualize the resulting paths via the code in this folder. 

## traffic_cruising_correlation.R
How does cruising rate on July 31 relate to traffic flow on July 31? To parking occupancy on May 19? (run the pipeline for may 19 to get a better comparison)
